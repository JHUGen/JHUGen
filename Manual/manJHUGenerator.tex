\noindent
The generator from \cite{Gao:2010qx,Bolognesi:2012,Anderson:2013,Gritsan:2016} is a model-independent generator for studying spin and parity properties of new resonances.
Please cite \cite{Gao:2010qx,Bolognesi:2012,Anderson:2013,Gritsan:2016} if using the "JHU generator".
The code can be downloaded from \cite{thesite}.
The generator outputs LHE files which can be passed to parton shower programs for hadronization.
Only relative values of cross sections are supposed to produce meaningful results, while absolute values are often subject to an arbitrary normalization.

Additionally, the package includes code for computing the matrix elements standalone which can be used in a numerical matrix element analysis.
Please reference the above papers and refer to "MELA" when using the matrix element likelihood analysis technique.
The latter was also introduced in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. The matrix element package (MELA) also depends
on MCFM libraries for background parameterization which should be referenced~\cite{Campbell:2010ff} when used.

\section{Installation}

\noindent
Register and download the package from \url{spin.pha.jhu.edu} and untar the file.  Go to the directory \verb|JHUGenerator| where the code exists for generating events with the JHU Generator. In the \verb|makefile|, you have two options for compiler, \verb|Comp = ifort| or \verb|Comp = gfort|.  Then simply compile with:
\begin{verbatim}
$ make
\end{verbatim}

\section{Quick start}

Examples of running the generator.  The number of events is determined using VegasNc2.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $gg$ production:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SM resonance, decay to $ZZ\to 4l$
		\begin{verbatim}
		./JHUGen Process=0 VegasNc2=100000 DecayMode1=0 DecayMode2=0 DataFile=ggHZZ4l
		\end{verbatim}
		\item pseudoscalar resonance, decay $WW\to 2l2\nu$:
		\begin{verbatim}
		./JHUGen Process=0 VegasNc2=100000 DecayMode1=4 DecayMode2=4 DataFile=ggHWW2l2nu_0- \\
		ghz1=0,0 ghz4=1,0
		\end{verbatim}

		\end{verbatim}
	\end{itemize}
	\item $VH$:

		\end{verbatim}
		\item $\gamma^*\to\gamma H$ (both $pp$ (default) and $e^+e^-$ Collider options possible):

	\end{verbatim}
	\item $pp \to t+H\text{ and }\bar{t}+H$ with inclusive top decay (change \verb|DecayMode1| for specific $t$ decays; use processes 110--113 restrict to either $t$ or $\bar{t}$ and either $s$ or $t$ channels):
	\begin{verbatim}
	./JHUGen Process=114 DecayMode1=11 VegasNc2=100000 DataFile=tH_s
	\end{verbatim}
	\item Decay-only mode, for generating $H\to VV$ decay in VBF, $H+j(j)$, $VH$, $ttbH$, or $tH$ production

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Process configuration}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|DecayMode1,2|:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|DecayMode1,2=7|: Valid for spin-0 and spin-2 or for $VH$.
\item In $VH$ production and \verb|ConvertLHE| mode, \verb|DecayMode1| is used for the decay of the $V$.  If it is a $Z$ decay mode, $ZH$ will be produced; if it is a $W$ decay mode, $WH$ will be produced; if it is $7$, $\gamma H$ will be produced, with $\gamma$ stable.
\item In $ttH$ production, if \verb|TopDK| is true, \verb|DecayMode1| and \verb|DecayMode2| are used to decay the $W$ bosons from the top decay.  Only $W$ decay modes are allowed.
\item In $t+H$ production, if \verb|TopDK| is true, \verb|DecayMode1| is used to decay the $W$ boson from the top decay.
\item In $H\to \tau\tau$ decay, if \verb|TauDK| is true, \verb|DecayMode1,2| are used to decay the $W$ bosons from the $\tau$ decays.
\end{itemize}
\item \verb|Interf|: For final states with 4 same flavor fermions, this parameter controls whether or not to include interference effects.
\item \verb|RandomizeVVdecays|: For $VV$ decay (and similarly in $ttH$ production), by default the $V$'s are randomized so that, for example, \verb|DecayMode1=5 DecayMode2=11| will produce all combinations that include at least one hadronic $W$ decay (rather of specifically hadronic decay of the $W^+$).  This can be switched off by setting \verb|RandomizeVVdecays=0|.  In this case, \verb|DecayMode1| will refer specifically to the $W^+$ and \verb|DecayMode2| to the $W^-$.  For $ZZ$ decay, this parameter only determines whether the decays of first and second $Z$ written to the LHE file are randomized or not; in this case the only effect is the appearance of the output.
\item \verb|PChannel|: This parameter is only meaningful in the spin-2 case and for the $ttH$ and $bbH$ production mechanisms.  For spin-0, production is possible only via the $gg$ process; for spin-1 and for the VBF, $VH$, and $tH$ processes, production is only possible via the $qq^\prime$ process.  For $H+jj$ and $H+j$, all parton channels $gg$, $qq^\prime$, and $qg$ are included.
\item \verb|ChannelRatio|: In the case when \verb|PChannel=2| for a spin-2 resonance, this parameter determines an approximate fraction of the events that should come from $q\bar{q}$.  This is equivalent to appropriately scaling the $Xq\bar{q}$ couplings with respect to the $Xgg$ ones, but can be done without advance knowledge of the relative cross sections.
\item \verb|PDFSet|, \verb|LHAPDF|, \verb|LHAPDFMem|: To use LHAPDF, this functionality must be enabled in the makefile and the relevant environment variables must be set.  See the instructions in Sec.~\ref{sec:LHAPDF}.  Otherwise \verb|PDFSet| gives the choice between a more limited number of PDF sets.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Resonance parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|OffshellX|}: The flag specifies whether the events for processes 0, 1 or 2 feature a delta-function resonance mass (when set to 0) at or a finite-width distribution around the resonance mass (when set to 1). This option replaces the \verb|OffXVV| numerical flag in previous versions.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cuts}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|pTjetcut|, \verb|deltaRcut|, \verb|mJJcut| All three cuts are used in processes 60 (VBF), 61 ($H+jj$), 90 ($bbH$), and also 80 ($ttH$) if \verb|m_Top| is set to be light ($<10 \text{GeV}$).  In addition, \verb|pTjetcut| is used in process 62 ($H+j$) and also processes 110--113 ($t/\bar{t}+H$) if \verb|m_Top| is light.
\item \verb|MPhotoncutoff| If the decay is to $ZZ$ and any of the couplings to photons (\verb|ghzgsX| or \verb|ghgsgsX|) is set, the $\gamma^*$ contribution will be included along with the $Z$'s.  Similarly, if the decay is to $Z\gamma$ and any of the \verb|ghgsgsX| couplings are set, the $\gamma\gamma^*$ contribution will be included as well.  In this case, a lower cut on the photon invariant mass has to be placed in order to avoid the collinear singularity.  This can be set using MPhotonCutoff.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Renormalization and factorization scales}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|FacScheme|, \verb|MuFacMultiplier|, and \verb|RenScheme|, \verb|MuRenMultiplier|: There are currently 10 different schemes, which set the basis of the scale up to the scale multiplier. A postive integer uses running scales per event whereas a negative one uses a fixed scale, and \verb|MuFacMultiplier| and \verb|MuRenMultiplier| determine the scale multipliers for the factorization and renormalization scales, respectively:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\pm0$: $\mu_{F,\,R}$ are set to the default values of each process. The command line values of \verb|MuFacMultiplier| and \verb|MuRenMultiplier| are disregarded.
		\item $\pm1$: $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_H}$ if the scheme number is positive, or $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_H$ if the scheme number is negative. $+1$ is the default value for \verb|Process| 0, 1 and 2 with scale multiplier $0.5$, and  $-1$ is the default value for \verb|Process| 50, 60, 61 and 62 with scale multiplier $1$.
		\item $\pm2$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{JJH}}$, where $J$ refers to a particle (partons or leptons) immediately associated in the Higgs production. If the scheme number is negative and the Higgs and the associated partons originate from a common particle (\eg $V^{*}$ in $VH$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{JJH}$.
		\item $\pm3$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{JJ}}+\sqrt{q^2_{H}}$. If the scheme number is negative and the associated particles originate from a common particle without the Higgs (\eg $V$ in $VH$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{JJ}+m_{H}$.
		\item $\pm4$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{J1}}+\sqrt{q^2_{J2}}+\sqrt{q^2_{H}}$, where $J_{1,\,2}$ are the associated particles. If the scheme number is negative and the matrix element treats the associated particles as massive (\eg $t$ and $\bar{t}$ in $t\bar{t}H$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{J1}+m_{J2}+m_{H}$.  $-4$ is the default value for \verb|Process| 80 and 90 with scale multiplier $0.5$.
		\item $\pm5$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{JJ}}$. If the scheme number is negative and the associated particles originate from a common particle without the Higgs (\eg $V$ in $VH$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{JJ}$.
		\item $\pm6$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{J1}}+\sqrt{q^2_{J2}}$, where $J_{1,\,2}$ are the associated particles. If the scheme number is negative and the matrix element treats the associated particles as massive (\eg $t$ and $\bar{t}$ in $t\bar{t}H$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{J1}+m_{J2}$.
		\item $\pm7$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{JH}}$, where $J$ is the more massive associated particle by its pole mass. If the scheme number is negative and the matrix element treats an associated particle as massive (\eg $t$ in $t+H$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{J}+m_{H}$ for the most massive associated particle.
		\item $\pm8$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{J}}+\sqrt{q^2_{H}}$, where $J$ is the more massive associated particle. If the scheme number is negative and the matrix element treats an associated particle as massive (\eg $t$ in $t+H$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{J}+m_{H}$ for the most massive associated particle (same as option -7).  $-8$ is the default value for \verb|Process| 110, 111, 112 and 113. with scale multiplier $0.25$.
		\item $\pm9$: If the scheme number is positive, $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto \sqrt{q^2_{J}}$, where $J$ is the more massive associated particle. If the scheme number is negative and the matrix element treats an associated particle as massive (\eg $t$ in $t+H$), $\mu_{F,\,R} \propto m_{J}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Lepton filter}
\begin{itemize}
\item Any combination of \verb|FilterNLept|, \verb|FilterOSPairs|, \verb|FilterOSSFPairs| can be used in ReadLHE mode to filter the events.  \verb|CountTauAsAny|, off by default, counts each tau as an electron or muon of the same sign towards an OSSF pair.
\item \verb|WriteFailedEvents|: By default, events that fail the lepton filter are not written to the LHE file.  If this option is set to 1, they are written, but their weight is set to 0.  If it is set to 2, they are written with a weight of zero and with no particles in the event (this saves disk space with  and is accepted by Pythia, but some parsers may not like it).  This option is useful if the same number of events are required to be in the input and the output.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Higgs propagator and decay width}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|WidthScheme|: This option controls the width scheme in JHUGen. The options are 1 for running width, 2 for fixed width, and 3 for the complex pole scheme~\cite{Passarino:2010qk,Goria:2011wa}. 2 is the default option.  Note that the parameter values have the same meaning as in POWHEG.
\item \verb|WidthSchemeIn|: In \verb|ReadLHE| mode, if this is specified and is different than \verb|WidthScheme|, the resonance propagator will be reweighted between the three options specified above by multiplying the LHE weight of each event by the ratio of the propagators.
\item \verb|ReweightDecay|: By default, in \verb|ReadLHE| mode, output events are written with the same weight as in the input file.  For a wide resonance, this is not fully correct.  The full probability for a $gg\to X\to VV\to 4f$ event can be written as
\[
P(gg\to X\to VV\to 4f)=P_{prod}(m_{4f},\vec{\Omega}_{prod})\times P_{dec}(m_{4f})\times P_{dec}(\vec{\Omega}_{decay}\mid m_{4f})
\]
While the first factor is generated by the input generator and the third by JHUGen, by default the second factor, the decay contribution to the mass shape, is lost.  If \verb|ReweightDecay=1|, this term will be multiplied into the weight of the event written in the LHE file.
\begin{itemize}
\item If POWHEG was generated with a fixed width line shape, the full $P_{dec}(m_{4f})$ is multiplied into the weight.
\item If POWHEG was generated with the CPS option, then $m_{4f}\Gamma_H$, which is proportional to $P_{X\to \text{anything}}(m_{4l})$, is already included in the line shape.  This is not exactly correct, as what is needed is the more specific $P_{X\to\text{(decay mode)}}$.  The weight is therefore multiplied by the branching fraction.
\end{itemize}
To select one of these options, POWHEG input decay mode is specified by \verb|WidthSchemeIn|.  Alternatively, JHUGen will try to read the parameter \verb|bwshape| from the header of the POWHEG file.  Using other input generators requires an advance knowledge of how the line shape is generated; if neither of these options applies it may be simpler to apply a similar weight after the fact rather than in the LHE file.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|PmHstarEvals|: Controls the number of evaluations per mass point.  The default is 200000 at high masses, corresponding to a precision of about $0.2\%$, but increases at lower \verb|m_Reso|, where the offshell $Z$'s make the integration less efficient.
\item \verb|PmHstarFile|: After each run using \verb|ReweightDecay|, the distribution is written to a file specified by this option (default: \verb|PMZZdistribution.out|).
\item \verb|ReadPmHstar|: Read in distribution from \verb|PmHstarFile| instead of calculating it again.  This only makes sense if the \verb|DecayModes|, couplings, etc. are the same as last time; otherwise you will read a distribution that no longer makes sense.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Statistics options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|VegasNc0,1,2|: For unweighted event generation \verb|VegasNc0| specifies the number of evaluations for the initial integrand scan.  The actual event generation is controlled by either \verb|VegasNc1| or \verb|VegasNc2|. \verb|VegasNc1| specifies the number of tries in the accept/reject phase and \verb|VegasNc2| is the number of generated events. When generating unweighted events in \verb|ReadLHE| mode, both \verb|VegasNc1| or \verb|VegasNc2| can be used to specify the number of generated events. For the generation of weighted events \verb|VegasNc1| specifies the number of evaluations for each of 5 iterations during the initial integrand scan. \verb|VegasNc2| gives the (approximate) number of generated weighted events.
\item \verb|ReadCSmax|: If \verb|ReadCSmax| is specified on the command line, the grid generation step is skipped and the results are read from a file.  This can speed up the process by running a short job first, and then many jobs in parallel using this option.  This only makes sense if the couplings, etc. are the same as last time; otherwise your results won't make sense.
\item \verb|Seed|: To reproduce previous results, the random seed can be set on the command line.  Because Fortran uses multiple random seeds (the exact number is compiler dependent), the seed provided is used along with other fixed seeds specified in \verb|mod_Parameters.F90| to generate however many seeds are needed.  If no seed is provided on the command line, the seed is determined from the system time and process id.  Either way, it is printed in the header of the output file so that the results can be reproduced.

Please note that random number generation is compiler dependent, so to ensure reproducibility the same compiler (and preferably the same version of the compiler) should be used.  To facilitate this, the compiler and version are written in the header of the LHE file.  It is also not guaranteed that the results can be reproduced using a different version of the generator.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Couplings}
The general syntax is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|ghgX|, \verb|ghzX|, \verb|ghzX_primeY|, \verb|cz_qXsq|, \verb|Lambda_zXY|, \verb|ghwX|, \verb|ghwX_primeY|, \verb|cw_qXsq|, \verb|Lambda_wXY|, \verb|ghzgsX|, \verb|ghzgs1_prime2|, and \verb|ghgsgsX| for spin 0 $HVV$ couplings (see the list for the ranges of X and Y)
\item \verb|zprime_qq_left|, \verb|zprime_qq_right|, \verb|zprime_zz_1|, and \verb|zprime_zz_2| for spin 1
\item \verb|aX|, \verb|bX|, \verb|graviton_qq_left|, \verb|and graviton_qq_right| for spin 2 (see the list for the range of X)
\item The $Hff$ couplings \verb|kappa| and \verb|kappa_tilde|
\end{itemize}
Except for the form factors (\verb|cz_qXsq|, \verb|Lambda_zXY|, and their $WW$ equivalents), the couplings are complex, and must be set with a comma between the real and imaginary parts.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
ghz1=0,0 ghz4=1,0
\end{verbatim}
If an anomalous coupling is turned on, the default coupling in the same category must also be specified to leave it on or turn it off.  For example, if \verb|ghz4| is specified, \verb|ghz1| must either be set to \verb|0,0| to generate a pure pseudoscalar or to some other value to generate a $CP$-violating mixture.

In the weak vector boson fusion process (VBF) we also allow for different $ZZH$ and $WWH$ couplings.  Per default, they are assumed to be equal, set by the $Z$ couplings; however, if any of the $W$ couplings are set, they will be used instead for $WWH$ fusion.  $WWH$ can be turned off entirely by explicitly setting one of them to \verb|0,0|.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Spin-0 parameters}
\label{spin0}

\noindent
The \verb|ghg*| parameters control the coupling of a spin-0 resonance to gluons in the production mechanism.
In practice, the production parameters do not have a large effect since angular corrections from the production mechanism are lost for spinless particles.
The \verb|ghz*| parameters control the decay into $Z$ and $W$ bosons.
These spin-0 couplings are described in Eq.(9) from Ref.~\cite{Bolognesi:2012}, and can be set from the command line.
We allow for $q^2$ dependent form factors similar to those described in Ref.~\cite{Anderson:2013}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	g^\Lambda_i(q_1,q_2) &=&
	g_i' \frac{\Lambda_i^4}{\left(\Lambda_i^2 + |q_1^2|\right)\left(\Lambda_i^2 + |q_2^2|\right)} \\
	&+& g_i^{\prime 2}  \frac{\left(q_1^2+q_2^2\right)}{\Lambda_i^2}
	+ g_i^{\prime 3}  \frac{\left(q_1^2-q_2^2\right)}{\Lambda_i^2}
	+ g_i^{\prime 4}  \frac{\left(q_1+q_2\right)^2}{\Lambda_Q^2} \\
	&+& g_i^{\prime 5}  \frac{\left(\left(q_1^2\right)^2+\left(q_2^2\right)^2\right)}{\Lambda_i^4}
	+ g_i^{\prime 6}  \frac{\left(\left(q_1^2\right)^2-\left(q_2^2\right)^2\right)}{\Lambda_i^4}
	+ g_i^{\prime 7}  \frac{q_1^2 \, q_2^2}{\Lambda_i^4} \\
	g_i\left(q_1,q_2\right) &=& g_i \delta_{i1} + \left(g^\Lambda_i \left(q_1,q_2\right) + g_i \left(1- \delta_{i1}\right)\right)
	\frac{\Lambda^2_{i1}\,\Lambda^2_{i2}\,\Lambda^2_{i3}}
	{\left(\Lambda^2_{i1}+c_{i1}\left|q_1^2\right|\right)\,\left(\Lambda^2_{i2}+c_{i2}\left|q_2^2\right|\right)\,\left(\Lambda^2_{i3}+c_{i3}\left|(q_1+q_2)^2\right|\right)}
	\noindent
\end{eqnarray*}
The user has the option to choose between these functional forms,
where the term multiplying $g_i^\prime$ corresponds to the full functional form and the $g_i^{\prime 2}... g_i^{\prime 7}$ correspond to an expansion in $\Lambda^2$.
The names and default values of these parameters are found in \verb|mod_Parameters.F90|.  To set them on the command line, use, for example, \verb|ghz1=1,0|, where 1 represents the real part and 0 represents the imaginary part.

Intermediate off-shell photons can be included along with the $Z$ boson for $Z$ boson final states, $ZH$ production, and VBF production.

where the first three correspond to $Z\gamma^*$ couplings and the latter three corresponds to $\gamma^* \gamma^*$ interactions.
These two sets of parameters also control the coupling strength in final states with on-shell photons, i.e. $H\to Z\gamma$ or $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decays and $Z^*/\gamma^*\to\gamma H$ production.
The anomalous coupling involving the off-shell photon momentum (in $\gamma^* Z$ interactions)
\[

\paragraph{Spin-1 parameters}
\label{spin1}

The parameters below represent the couplings given in Eq.~(16) from Ref.~\cite{Bolognesi:2012}. The \verb|zprime_qq_*| parameters control the production of the spin-1 resonance while the \verb|zprime_zz_*| parameters control the decay.

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration in parameter file }

Some more advanced parameters can be found in \verb|mod_Parameters.F90|.  These include SM parameters such as the masses of particles and electroweak couplings, which can be changed for precise syncing with other generators used, for example.  Look for the \verb|!constants| section.

\verb|mod_Parameters.F90| also contains alternate schemes for setting the spin 0 and spin 2 couplings, specified by Eq.~(11) of \cite{Bolognesi:2012} instead of Eq.~(9) and Eq.~(20) instead of Eq.~(18).  To enable these couplings, set \verb|generate_as| to \verb|.true.| and set the \verb|ahg*| and \verb|ahz*| couplings for spin 0, or set \verb|generate_bis| to \verb|.false.| and set the \verb|c*| couplings for spin 2.

Note that these alternate couplings only work for processes 0 and 2, not for other production modes that use spin 0 couplings.

Any modification to \verb|mod_Parameters.F90| requires recompiling JHUGen.

\section{Examples}

\noindent
The below examples are not meant to be a complete set, but rather some interesting and relevant cases.
In many cases, the example is not the only way to produce such a scenario.

\subsection{$J^P = 0^+_m$ resonance, $X \to ZZ~{\rm or}~WW$}
\label{sec:exA}

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen ghz1=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{$J^P = 0^-_m$ resonance, $X \to ZZ~{\rm or}~WW$}
\label{sec:exB}

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen ghz1=0,0 ghz4=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{$J^P = 0^+_m$ resonance, $X \to \gamma \gamma$}
\label{sec:exC}

In practice, the example $X \to \gamma \gamma$ from this section, Sec.~\ref{sec:exC} and the next Sec.~\ref{sec:exD} are
kinematically the same but are presented only to illustrate how one takes care of this final state.  However, in the case of Sec.~\ref{sec:exE}, the couplings chosen do affect the kinematics.

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen DecayMode1=7 DecayMode2=7 ghgsgs2=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{$J^P = 0^-_m$ resonance, $X \to \gamma \gamma$}
\label{sec:exD}

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen DecayMode1=7 DecayMode2=7 ghgsgs4=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{$J^P=0^-_m$ resonance, $X\to\gamma^*\gamma^*\to4\ell$}
\label{sec:exE}

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen DecayMode1=0 DecayMode2=0 ghz1=0,0 ghgsgs4=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{$J^P = 2^+_m$ resonance, $X \to ZZ\text{ or }WW\text{ or }~\gamma\gamma$}

\begin{verbatim}
./JHUGen Process=2 a1=1,0 a2=0,0 b1=1,0 b2=0,0 b5=1,0 (...other options)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Cross-section calculation and fraction notation}

For a vector boson coupling, we can represent the four independent parameters by two  fractions
($f_{g2}$ and $f_{g4}$) and two phases ($\phi_{g2}$ and $\phi_{g4}$), defined for the $HZZ$
and $HWW$ couplings as follows (ignoring $g_3$)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&& f_{gi} =  \frac{|g^{}_{i}|^2\sigma_i}{|g^{}_{1}|^2\sigma_1+|g^{}_{2}|^2\sigma_2+|g^{}_{4}|^2\sigma_4}\,;
~~~~~~~~~
 \phi_{gi} = \arg\left(\frac{g_i}{g_1}\right)\,.
\nonumber
\label{eq:fractions}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to obtain the cross-sections $\sigma_i$ corresponding to the $g^{}_{i}=1$ coupling,
generate large enough (e.g. VegasNc1=1000000, VegasNc2=50000000) number of weighted
({\tt Unweighted=0}) with the corresponding couplings setup ($g^{}_{i}=1$, $g^{}_{j\ne i}=0$).

\subsection{LHAPDF}
\label{sec:LHAPDF}

It is possible to interface to an LHAPDF setup instead of compiling with local PDF's.  To accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the makefile:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set UseLHAPDF=Yes
\item Set MyLHADir to a directory with your LHAPDF setup.  This can be in terms of environment variables; for example \verb|MyLHADir=${LHAPDF_DATA_PATH}/../../lib/| should work as long as \verb|${LHAPDF_DATA_PATH}| only contains one directory.
\end{itemize}
\item Ensure that \verb|$LHAPDF_DATA_PATH| and \verb|$LD_LIBRARY_PATH| are set (both when compiling and when running).
\item Compile
\item Run with the extra command line parameter \verb|LHAPDF| specifying your PDF set's \verb|.info| file.  For example: \verb|LHAPDF=NNPDF30_lo_as_0130/NNPDF30_lo_as_0130.info|
\end{itemize}

\section{JHU Generator Matrix Elements (JHUGenMELA)}

After extracting the code, you can go to the directory \verb|JHUGenMELA| to find code for computing matrix elements directly.
To compile the code, simply run \texttt{make}.

\textbf{Please take note: The setup is configured for \texttt{gfort + gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-50)} and it is highly dependent on the compiler version.  Please configure for your own setup accordingly.}  (Using the \verb|nm| command will help decipher the module names you will need)

Instructions for setting up the JHUGenMELA with MCFM are in the file \verb|JHUGenMELA/ggZZ_MCFM/README|. This \verb|C++| interface also covers the native matrix elements aforementioned through the wrapper class \verb|TEvtProb|. The class currently includes the following calls:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|TEvtProb|: Constructor with argument $\sqrt{s}$ in units of GeV.
\item \verb|SetProcess|: Set the process to be used in te calculation of the ME
\item \verb|SetMatrixElement|: Set the matrix element (Analytical, MCFM or JHUGen)
\item \verb|SetProduction|: Set the production (as enumerated in the TVar class)
\item \verb|SetLeptonInterf|: Set whether lepton interference is included in decay MEs. By default, it is included for JHUGen decay MEs or MCFM $q\bar{q}$ background MEs. It is not included in the other MCFM MEs.

\item \verb|ResetMCFM_EWKParameters|: Reset the MCFM EWK scheme and its parameters. See MCFM manual for the details on the EWK scheme.

\item \verb|Set_LHAgrid|: One-time call to setup the PDF path in case NNPDF 3.0 is used.

\item \verb|XsecCalc|: Calls to the decay MEs are handled through this function. Depending on the type of process, the self-defined coupling arrays may be ignored. Uses the following interfaced fortran subroutines:
\begin{itemize}

\item "modgraviton\_\_evalamp\_g\_vv": Spin-2 matrix elements production-independent
\end{itemize}

\item \verb|XsecCalcXJJ|: Calls to VBF, and $Hjj$ MEs are handled from this function. Depending on the production mode or the process, these arrays may be ignored.
\begin{itemize}
\item "modhiggsjj\_\_evalamp\_wbfh": Spin-0 matrix element for on-shell $VBF$ production
\item "modhiggsjj\_\_evalamp\_sbfh": Spin-0 matrix element for on-shell $H+JJ$ QCD production

\item "modvhiggs\_\_evalamp\_vhiggs": Spin-0 matrix element for on-shell $VH$ production
\end{itemize}

\item \verb|XsecCalc_TTX|: Call to te $t\bar{t}H$ ME is handled through this routine.
\begin{itemize}
\item "modttbhiggs\_\_evalxsec\_pp\_ttbh": Spin-0 matrix element for on-shell $t\bar{t}H$ production
\item "modttbhiggs\_\_evalxsec\_pp\_bbbh": Spin-0 matrix element for on-shell $b\bar{b}H$ production
\end{itemize}

\item \verb|SetHiggsMass|: This routine changes the Higgs mass and width used in the MCFM calculations.

\end{itemize}

The inputs are usually the 4-vectors of the incoming patrons and outgoing particles in the CM frame of the object $X$.
In addition the mass and width of the resonance are required as well as the ID of the outgoing particles.
Finally the last set of inputs are the couplings themselves.  They are arrays for parameters for a given spin hypothesis
which mirror the parameters configurable in \verb|mod_Parameters.F90|.
Exemplary array initialization can be found in \verb|testprogram.c| for the native matrix elements or \verb|testME.C| for the interface with MCFM.
For the interface, you can also see the beginning declarations in \verb|TVar.hh| for the list of enumerated variables, and \verb|testME.C| for example calls (eg. array filling, assignment of momenta, and passing te arguments to these routines).

\section{Specific configurations}

We define configurations for certain models which are defined in Table~1 of~\cite{Bolognesi:2012}.

\subsection{Spin 0}
All couplings not specified are 0 by default except for the SM couplings \verb|ghz1| and \verb|ghg2|, which must be set to 0 explicitly if that is desired.  For protection, if any anomalous couplings in the same category are set, those couplings must be explicitly set either to 0,0 or to some other value.

%%%-------- 0+
\subsubsection{"SM-like spin-zero", $0^+$}

\verb|ghz1=1,0|

%%%-------- 0+h
\subsubsection{"Higher order spin-zero", $0_h^+$}

\verb|ghz1=0,0 ghz2=1,0|

%%%-------- 0-
\subsubsection{"Pseudoscalar spin-zero", $0^-$}

\verb|ghz1=0,0 ghz4=1,0 ghg2=0,0 ghg4=1,0|

\subsection{Spin 1}
The $Z^\prime VV$ couplings \verb|zprime_zz_1| and \verb|zprime_zz_2| are both 0 by default; at least one of them must be explicitly turned on.  The $Z^{\prime}q\bar{q}$ couplings \verb|zprime_qq_left| and \verb|zprime_qq_right| are both set to 1 by default; if one is changed, then both must be explicitly set.

%%%-------- 1-
\subsubsection{"Vector spin-one", $1^-$}

\verb|zprime_qq_left=1,0 zprime_qq_right=0,0 zprime_zz_1=1,0|

%%%-------- 1+
\subsubsection{"Pseudovector spin-one", $1^+$}

\verb|zprime_qq_left=1,0 zprime_qq_right=0,0 zprime_zz_2=1,0|

\subsection{Spin 2}
The $Ggg$ and $GVV$ couplings \verb|a1-5| and \verb|b1-10| are set to 0 by default; at least one in each category must be explicitly turned on.  The $Gq\bar{q}$ couplings \verb|graviton_qq_left| and \verb|graviton_qq_right| are both set to 1 by default; if one is changed, then both must be explicitly set.

If an exclusive production mode is desired (e.g. $q\bar{q}$ or $gg$), this is handled at command-line configuration level via the \verb|PChannel| variable.

%%%-------- 2+
\subsubsection{"Minimal Graviton, spin-two", $2^+$}


\verb|a1=1,0 b1=1,0 b5=1,0|

%%%-------- 2+h
\subsubsection{"Higher order Graviton, spin-two", $2^+_h$}

\verb|a4=1,0 b4=1,0|

%%%-------- 2-h
\subsubsection{"Higher order Graviton, spin-two", $2^-_h$}

\verb|a5=1,0 b8=1,0|
