This subdirectory contains all files necessary for implementing a
recursion scheme that is appropriate when all momenta are small, but
the propagator differences ("f(k)") are not.

It is based on:

 A.~Denner and S.~Dittmaier,
 %``Reduction schemes for one-loop tensor integrals,''
 Nucl.\ Phys.\  B {\bf 734}, 62 (2006)
 [arXiv:hep-ph/0509141].

The scheme is described in section 5.6 and the recursion here is based
on equations (5.64)-(5.70) and their extensions.

The routines calculate triangle and box integrals up to:

rank 4 (with at least one recursion)
rank 5 (with no recursion)
rank 6 (no recursion, 00iiii components only)
